```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"
gun_deaths <- read_csv(url)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
youth <- gun_deaths %>% 
  filter(age <= 65)
```


We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` gun deaths Only 
`r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` age less than or equal to 65 
The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() + labs(x= "Victim Race")
```
